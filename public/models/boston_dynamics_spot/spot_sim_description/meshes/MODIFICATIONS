This directory contains data sampled from the Boston Dynamics Spot, and subject to the included license.

The files found under: spot/spot_sim_description/meshes were constructed in the following fashion.

1) Calls were made to GetRobotLinkModel() from the Spot SDK (RobotStateServiceProto).
2) This call returns an dae for the links of the robot.
3) These were converted into dae (Wavefront).


The file spot_whole_body.dae, found in spot/spot_gazebo/models was constructed in the following fashion.

1) A mesh was constructed in Blender from the obj/dae files in the previous step.

The Boston Dynamics Spot SDK repository now contains a URDF and corresponding meshes, which could be used to develop a similar .dae.
